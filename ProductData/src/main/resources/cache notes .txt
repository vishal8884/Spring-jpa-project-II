 Cache Concurrency stratagy
 
 1) READ_ONLY -> Only when read only...takes data from db and displays to user...if tried to updated exception will be thrown
 2) NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE -> not fully consistancy
 3) READ_WRITE -> more consistancy...it has lock with cache
 4) TRANSACTIONAL -> if we have 2 db or distributed transaction
